## Subject: Weighted - undirected graph

The project contains classes represents an  weighted - undirected graph and its vertices. it also contains the class Graph_Algo that holds methods that perform some operations on a given garph.


## The operations:

 - isConnected: check if the given graph is connected, means that for any vertex their is a path to every other vertex.
 - shortestPathDist: for some two given vertices, compute the size of the shortest path from one to another.
- shortestPath: for some two given vertices, return a list holds the vertices of the shortest path from one to another.

## How to use?

 Create some Test class in the package ex1 and run the code below (**for example**):
 

    public static void main(String[] args) {  
  
	    weighted_graph graph = new WGraph_DS();  
	    for (int i = 0; i <= 4; i++) {  
	        graph.addNode(i);  
	    }  
	    graph.connect(4, 1);  
	    graph.connect(1, 3);  
	    graph.connect(2, 3);  
	    graph.connect(4, 3);  
	    graph.connect(0, 4);  
	    graph.connect(0, 1);  
	    graph.connect(1, 2);  
	    WGraph_Algo ga = new WGraph_Algo();  
	    ga.init(graph);  
  
	    System.out.println(ga.isConnected());  
	    System.out.println(ga.shortestPathDist(0, 2));  
	    System.out.println(ga.shortestPath(0, 2));  
    }
The code creates the graph:

The output of this example program shoud be:

    true
    4
    [#0 , #1 , #2 ]

## Algorithms used:
For those three mentioned operations i used some variations of the BFS algorithm and dijkstra algorithm.
